1. def
risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal process, people and systems or from external events
include: legal risk
does not include: strategic and reputation risk

2. risk event
high frequency/low severity (HFLS)
low frequency/high severity (LFHS)

3. sources in OpRIsk framework
- internal loss data
  HFLS
  problems: 
  [1] not enough data  -  workshop/scenario data
  [2] pre-acquisition, varying data collection threshold - set collection threshold
  solution:
  provision
  - not recognized for future operating loss
  - recoginized for onerous contract
  - provision for restructing cost should be recognized only when detailed format plan/valid expection
  
- business environment and internal control factors (BEICFs)
  [1] risk control self-assessment (RCSA)
  [2] key risk indicators (KRIs)
  
- external data
  problems:
  [1] not representative data
  [2] strong bias in large and well-publicized losses - operational risk capital up
  [3] relevence-based filtering
  [4] size differential
  
- scenario analysis
  mostly from expert opinions, which would result in
  presentation bias(order of speech)/ availability bias/ anchoring bias/ "huddle" bias or anxiety bias (unwilling to confront)
  gaming/ over/under confidence bias/ inexpert opinion/ context bias
  
4. assess op risk
- top-down
  simple/ non-intensive data/ undifferentiated from HFLS and LFHS/ no diagnostic ability/ backward-looking
  [1] BIA - basic indicator approach
      operational risk capital of BIA = certain percentage of average gross income (net interest income + non-interest income)
      ORC_BIA = alpha * GI
      where GI of a single year cannot be lower than 0, alpha = 15%
  [2] SA - standardized approach
      separate business into 8 business line, different weight in business line
      18% weighting: corporate finance/ trading and sales/ settlement and pmt activities
      15% weighting: commercial banking/ angency and custody services
      12% weighting: retail banking/ retail brokerage/ asset management
      ORC_SA = sum over max(GI * beta,0)/3
  [3] ASA - alternative standardized approach
      different from SA in retail banking and commercial banking
      K = beta * m * LA
      where K - capital charge, beta - weight for business line, m - coef
            LA - retail loans and advances, averaged over the past three years
            
- botton-up
  complex/ intensive data/ differentiated from HFLS and LFHS/ diagnostic ability/ forward-looking
  advanced measurement approach (AMA)
  own model of each bank for calculating operational risk capital
      7 categories of operational risk
      - client, products, and business practices (LFHS)
        confidential info, money luandering, market manipulation, model flaw
      - internal fraud (LFHS)
        (intentive) misreporting data, insider trading, unauthorized trading, forgery, embezzlement, bribe, smuggling
      - external fraud
        disobey the law, misuse property, robbery, computer hacking
      - damage to physical assets
        natural disasters
      - execution, delivery, and process management (HFLS)
        (unintentive) data errors, unfinsihed legal document
      - business disruption and system failures
        computer failure
      - employment and workplace safety
  [1] LDA
      assume i.i.d losses within a unit
      usually equal weighting in 8 business line * 7 categories, except split loss/out-dated/external data
      - frequency distribution
        binomial/ poisson/ negative binomial
      - severity distribution 
        lognormal/ weibull/ gamma/ exponential (thin tail, like normal distribution)
        suited for HFLS, internal losses
        pareto/ GPD (fat tail)
        suited for LFHS
      - convolution
        given frequency and severity distribution, list all possible scenarios
        sort scenarios by loss, and get cumulative probaility
        economic capital/operational risk capital = VaR - EL = VaR - E(prob)*E(sever)  (if independent)
      - aggregation
        aggregate loss distribution of different business lines
        linear assumption - correlation
        non-linear - copulas
        perfectly dependent - add them together
  [2] scenario analysis approach
      to identify fat-tail events
      pro - future events
      con - highly subjective, few data points
  [3] hybrid approach
      combine LDA and hybird, pro and con are present
      
5. management of Op risk
three lines of defense
  [1] business line management
      product activities, process
  [2] independent corporate operation risk function (CORF)
      risk meansurement and reporting, risk committees, board reporting
      input and output of business line, risk management, measurement and reporting systems
  [3] independent review

principles
  - board of directors set up culture/ bank set up framework accordingly
  - board of directors review framework and risk appetite/ senior management set up governance structure
  - senior management assess all and new things, monitor risk/ banks too/ banks operate on ongoing basis
  - bank disclose to stakeholder
  
board of directors should
  - establish code of conduct, mgt culture and dynamically oversight
  - provide senior mgt with guidence
  - regularly review the framework/audit
  
senior mgt should
  - establish and maintain specific mechanism
  - translate operational risk mgt. framework
  - assign authority and responsibility
  - ensure staff communication, coordination/ bank activities

tools
  audit findings/ internal and external data collection and analysis/ risk assessments
  business process mapping/ risk indicators/ scenario analysis
  measurement/ comparative analysis
  
effective control enviroment
  - appropriate segregation of duties
  - dual control
  
managing tech risk

managing outsourcing risk
  - whether and how to outsource
  - due diligence on structure/financial condition
  - get contingency plans/ allocation of responsibility
  
6. management of outsourcing
risk sources
compliance/ concentration/ repurational/ country/ operational/ legal

core element
  - risk assessment
  - due diligence
    business background, reputation and strategy
    financial condition
    operational and internal controls
  - contract provisions
    scope/ cost/ performance standards/ confidence/ license/ termination/ insurance/ compliants
    subcontracting - same provision apply/due diligence/ info and data
  - incentive compensation
  - monitoring
  - continuity and contingency
