1. classifications 
[1] transaction liquidity risk
- risk of moving the price of an asset advesely in the act of buying or selling
  low if assets can be liquidated quickly, cheaply and lower mkt impact
- asset is liquid if it is a good substitute for cash, and with low liquidity premium
- mkt is liquid if mkt participants can put on or unwind position quickly, without excessive cost
[2] bal sheet risk a.k.a funding liquidity risk
- creditors withdraw credit
[3] systemic risk
- impaired ability of financial system to allocate credit/ support mkts/ settle transactions

2. factors that affect transaction liquidity
- # traders/ frequency and size of trades/ time/ cost
- bid-ask spread as a measure
[1] exogenous
if position is small for the market, the spread is exogenous
liquidity VaR = VaR + liquidity cost
where liquidity cost = 0.5 * asset value * spread
      spread = (ask - bid)/((ask + bid)/2)
- normal approach
if VaR ~ normal, mean = 0, liquidity VaR = V*Z*sigma + 0.5*V*spread
LVaR/VaR = 1 + 0.5*spread/(sigma*Z)
- lognormal approach
if VaR ~ lognormal, mean = 0, liquidity VaR = V*(1-exp(-Z*sigma)) + 0.5*V*spread
LVaR/VaR = 1 + 0.5*spread/(1-exp(-sigma*Z)
-
for both normal and lognormal case, 
LVaR/VaR is positively correlated with spread(larger liquidity per), 
negatively correlated with confidence, holding period (larger VaR per)
- random spread
assume spread could take an extreme value
LVaR = VaR + 0.5 * [spread_mean + Z' * spread_sigma]*V
VaR could take normal or lognormal

[2] endogenous
market impact, based on the responsiveness of the market
elasticity E = (d_p/p)/(d_N/N)   -  price change by one percent trade    
LVaR = VaR * (1 - d_p/p) = VaR * (1 - E * (d_N/N))

3. funding liquidity
liquidity at risk (LaR) - maximum likely cash outflow
factors that affect LaR:
borrowing and lending/ margin requirements/ collateral obligations/ exercise of options

4. approaches to estimate crisis liquidity risk
[1] crash metrics
P/L = delta*d_S + (gamma/2)*(d_s)^2
argmax P/L = -delta/gamma
max P/L = delta^2/gamma
[2] worst-case
[3] crisis-scenario analysis

5. repo
short-term loan secured by collateral, 
a party sells a security at a specified price with a commitment to buy back the security at another specified price
final price = inital price * (1 + rate*n/365)
where rate - yearly rate, n - repo days
repo borrower lend money from repo investor
- reverse repo
repo investor as initiator
- GFC
repo borrower unable to meet margin call/ insufficient collateral
raising haircut/ unwilling to take low-quality collateral
- general collater
lenders want to do cash management, therefore only care about the quality of collateral,
but not a particular security or class
'the' GC rate - U.S. Treasury as collateral
fed funds-GC spread = federal funds rate (with credit risk) - the GC rate
the spread widens when Treasuries become more scarcer, higher price, lower return, lower GC rate
                       or financial stress
- special collateral
lenders want to do security financing, therefore want to get a particular security as collater,
short it, buy back later, make a profit, then give it back to repo borrower
special spreads = the GC rate - special rates
newly-issued bond (on-the-run) often trade special (lower repo rate), then goes off-the-run, old, double-old (gc)

6. source of liquidity risk
- markets for collateral
[1] margin loans
you have stocks, pledge the stock to borrow money, then use the money to buy other stocks
[2] repo
spot sale and forward repurcahse. creates liability on economic bal sheet
[3] securties lending
borrow stocks on a rebate, then short and buy back later
if there is dividend, the lender would require the dividend
- banks and hedge funds (funding risk)
rollover risk - short-term debt cannot be refinanced easily
asset-liability management - avilable cash and short-term securities, trade-off between capital reserve and return
LBO - leveraged buyout, take additional debt to acquire

6. leverage
R_equity = Leverage * R_asset - (Leverage - 1)*R_debt
gross leverage = all asset/ capital
net leverage = (long position - short position)/ capital
