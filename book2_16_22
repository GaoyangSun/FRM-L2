- three pillars of credict risk
- PD (probaility of default)  LR (loss rate)  EA (exposure amount)

READING 16: the credit decision
1. credit risk comes from
- default on an obligation
- increased PD
- increased LR
- increased EA
- settlement risk

2. 4 primary components of credict risk evaluation
- obligor's capacity and willingness to repay
- external conditions
- attributes of obligation (fixed or floating)
- credit risk mitigants

3. credit analysis techiniques
- qualitative to decide willingness to pay
  gather info/face-to-face meetings/"name lending"/extrapolating last performance into future
  
- quantitative to decide ability to pay
  examine the past, current, forecasted financial statements
  limitations: historical nature of the data/ difficult to make accurate projections
  
4. categories of analysis
[1] consumers
    - credit score
[2] corporations
    - liquidity, cash flow with earning capacity and profitability
[3] financial institutions
    - capital adequacy, asset quality, ability to withstand financial stress
    - bank insolvency <> backruptcy
[4] sovereigns
    - external debt, tax receipts
    
5. measures
PD - probaility of default
LGD - loss given default
EAD - exposure at default
EL - expected loss = PD * LGD * EAD
time horizon - the longere the horizon, the greater the risk

READING 18: classifications of credit risk
1. credit ratings are critical in ensuring
- borrowers can access capital market
- the various risks of value creation are appropriately managed
- the economic performance of business units can be compared

2. classification
- default(counterparty) risk
  measured by PD, which can be approached by 
  [1] analyze historical default frequencies
  [2] statistical [3] hybird approach combining quant and qual approach
  [4] extract implicit default probailities
- recovery risk
  measured by LGD, which depends on
  [1] type of credit contracts [2] general economic conditions [3] covenants
- exposure risk
  measured by EAD, calculated by 
  EAD = drawn amount + (limit - drawn amount) * LEQ
  where drawn amount = amount of the credit facility currently used
               limit = max amount granted by a bank to the borrower
                 LEQ = loan equivalency factor
                 
3. measurement
- EL = PD * LGD * EAD = PD * (1-Recovery rate) * EAD
- Unexpected Loss = credit VaR = WCL(worst case loss) - EL
- EL not affected by correlation, UL affected by correlation
- loss distribution and VaR measures can be done by
  [1] adopting a parametric method
  [2] numerical simulations
  [3] discrete probability solutions
- VaR and EL do not factor in portfolio concentration because of diversification
  so concentration risk should be noted, as VaR does not account for that
  default codependence can be modeled by 
  [1] asset value correlations
      consider the debt outstanding between two borrowers and look at the correlation among asset values
  [2] default correlations
      historical correlations 
- unexpected loss contribution
  ULC_i = (d_UL_portfolio/d_w_i)*W_i
        = correlation(i, portoflio) * W_i * UL_portfolio
  beta_i = (ULC_i/W_i)*UL_portfolio
  
4. risk-adjusted pricing
- risk-based pricing policy is important for 
  active portfolio management/ integrating credit, market and operational risk into risk budgeting
  setting management objective
- risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)/risk-adjusted reutrn on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC)
  both used to assess whether returns generated > market risk premium
  add value if RARORAC > ROE_target
- economic value added
  EVA = (RARORAC - cost of capital) * economic capital
- RARORAC = (spread + fees - EL - cost of capital - cost of opearions)/economic

5. credit VaR vs. market VaR
- market VaR
  symmetric distribution/99% VaR/daily horizon
- credit VaR
  asymmetric distribution(skewed to the left)/99.9% VaR/yearly horizon

6. portfolio with two asset
- correlation = (PD_12 - PD_1*PD_2)/sqrt(PD_1*(1-PD_1))*sqrt(PD_2*(1-PD_2))
  if correlation = 0, then independent
- correlation = 1
  consider them as one credit
  credit VaR = WCL - EL = LGD * EAD - EL
- correlation = 0
  credit VaR = WCL - EL = PD_p * LGD * EAD - EL
  PD_p follows bernouli distribution

READING 19: rating assignment methodologies
1. rating system
- objectivity and homogeneity
- specificity
- measurability and verifiability

2. approaches to predict default
- expert-based 
- statistical-based
  structural approaches - based on financial assumptions
  reduced-form approaches - purely statistical
- numerical

3. rating agencies
- moody's - issues
- S&P - issuer
- FITCH - issues and issuer

4. measurement of PD in rating system - based on historical data
- single period pd
  PD = default_t/total issuers
- cumulative pd
  PD_cumulative_t = sum over default_t/total issuers
- marginal pd
  PD_marginal_t = PD_cumu_t+1 - PD_cumu_t 
- forward probability
  PD_forward_t = default_t/survivied issuer @ beg
- survival rate
  SR_forward_t = 1 - PD_forward_t
  therefore, mul over SR_forward = SR_accum = 1 - PD_cumulative_t
- annualized default rate (ADR)
  discrete: (1-ADR_t)^t = 1 - PD_cumulative_t    ADR_t = 1 - (1-PD_cumulative_t)^(1/t)
  continuous: e^(-ADR_t*t) = 1 - PD_cumulative_t       ADR_t = - ln(1 - PD_cumulative_t)/t
  
5. consider a zero-coupon with face value of 1
(PD*RR + (1-PD)*1)/1+rf = 1/1+YTM
PD = (1/LGD) * (YTM - rf)/(1+YTM)
credit spread = YTM - rf ~ PD * LGD 
which makes perfect sense, credit spread linearly correlate with PD * LGD
credit risk premium ~ pricing of a unit loss from credit risk

6. spread01
- price change by on basis point change in credit spread
- z-spread is added to LIBOR to do discounting

7. Merton model
assume V - equity value ~ lognormal, K - bond value, Euro option, and all other BSM assumption
equity value in t1: max(V-K, 0) - call option with X as K, St as V
bond value in t1: min(K, V) = K - max(K-V,0) - risk-free asset - put option with X as K, St as V
- equity = V*N(d1) - Ke^(-rt)*N(d2)
  bond = V*N(-d1) + Ke^(-rt)*N(d2) = V - equity
- N(d2) = St>K i.e. prob(exec option)
  PD = 1 - N(d2) =  N(-d2)
- d1,2 = ln(V/Ke^(-rt))/sigma*sqrt(T) +/- sigma*sqrt(T)/2
  PD = N(-d2) = N((ln(K) - ln(V) - rt)/sigma*sqrt(T) + sigma*sqrt(T)/2)
- risk-neutral PD - risk-free rate
  physical PD - asset return
- debt = Ke^(-(rf + credit spread)*(T-t))
  credit spread = -ln(D/K)*(T-t) - rf
  
8. KMV model
- default point
  if LT/ST<1.5, debt = ST + 0.5*LT
  if LT/ST>1.5, debt = 0.7*(ST+LT)
- no need to assume V~lognormal
  d2 - historical data
  distance to default DtD = ln(V) - ln(K) + (r_risky - sigma^2/2) - 'other payouts'  /  sigma
                          = (ln(V) - ln(K))/sigma
                          
9. exponential and possion distribution
- possion
  measures the prob of an incident happens k times during a period, lambd being the average times
  P(x=k) = (lamdb^k/k!)/sum over lambd^k/k! = (lambd^k/k!)*e^(-lambd)
- exponentional
  measures the prob of an incident happens during 0~t, lambd (hazard rate) being the averge times
  cumulative default prob P(t*<t) = 1 - e^(-lambd*t)
  conditional default prob - no memory
- risk-neutral hazard rate
  lambd * LGD = credit spread
  lambd (hazard rate) = credit spread/LGD

10. other models
- LDA
  statistical based, reduced-form
  does not calculate PD, but determine whether it would default
  Z-score cut-off, .i.e discriminate threshold, Z = 2.675
  cutoff point adjust in an unbalanced sample  z + ln((q_solv*cost_solv)/(q_insolv*cost_insolv))
  which is z + ln((1-pd)%pd * (opportunity cost % LGD))
- logistic regression model
  ln(pd/1-pd) = beta0 + beta1*x1 + ...
  pd = 1/1+e^(-1*.....)
- cluster analysis
  aggregate on a specific homogeneity
- PCA
  orthogonally, less statistical 'noisy' feature
  usually followed by factor analysis
- cash-flow simulation
  pd = # future scenarios with default/ # total scenarios
  huge model risk, and expensive computation
- hueristic method
  minic human decision making procedures
- numerical method
  algorithmic method, often by NN
- creditMetrics (JP morgan)
  use ratings transition matrix, generate a distribution
- creditRisk+ (credit suisse)
  use possion distribution, similar to insurance companies, generate default/no default

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 20: credit risks and credit derivatives
1. Merton model
- Vt - firm value, F - face value of debt
value of equity St = max(Vt - F,0)
value of debt Dt = F - max(F - Vt,0) = Vt - max(Vt - F, 0)
St = V*N(d) - Fe^(-rt)*N(d - sigma*sqrt(t))
where d = ln(V/Ke^(-rt))/sigma*sqrt(t) + 0.5*sigma*sqrt(t)

2. credit spread
ytm = credit spread + rf = ln(F/D)/t
credit spread = -(1/t)*ln(D/F) - rf

3. subordinate debt
- if not in financial stress
  behave like senior debt, negatively correlated with time to maturity, firm volatility, anuual interest rate
- in in financial stress
  behave like equity, positively correlated with time to maturity, firm volatility, annual interest rate
  
4. interest rate dynamics
- Vasicek mode
d_r = k(theta - r)*d_t + sigma_t*epsilon_t
value of debt negatively correlate with cor(V,d_r), k, sigma_r, T

5. apply Merton model
PD = N(-d2) =  N(ln(F) - ln(V) - rt + 0.5*sigma^2*t / sigma*sqrt(t))
LGD = F*N(-d2) - Ve^(rt)N(-d1) = F * PD - Ve^(rt)*N(ln(F) - ln(V) - rt - 0.5*sigma^2*t / sigma*t)

6. credit portfolio models
- creditRisk+
  by a set of common risk factors for each obligor, each with its own sensitivity to factors
  assumes uncorrelated default 
- creditMetrics
  expected bond value E(BV_p) = sum over prob of migtrating * bond value @ a given rating
- KMV
  expected default frequencies(EDFs) for each obligor
  pro: provide a direct estimation of loss distribution based on the observed equity value
- creditPortfolioView
  models the transition matrices using macroeconomic or economic cycle
- limitations of models above
  do not account for changes in interest rataes/credit spread/current economic conditions

7. credit derivatives
ususally an OTC contract with payoffs contingent on a specified credit event
- credit default put
   pays at default
   risky bond = risk-free bond - put
- credit default swap (CDS)
  the purchaser gets credit protection and make fixed pmts thourghout the left of the product, until default
  may require the pmts recevier to purchase the underlying asset prior to default
  By means of settlement
  [1] cash settlement  
      reference asset still in CDS payer, recevier pays the difference
  [2] physical settlement
      reference asset transfer to CDS recevier, recevier pays the whole
  [3] digital CDS
      pays a fixed amount, not the difference
  By means of reference asset
  [1] single-name CDS
      one reference asset
  [2] basket CDS
      a basket of reference asset
      - Nth to default CDS
        pays off when the n-th default, amount being the difference of the latest n-th default entity (one entity)
        high correlation, harder to trigger first-to default, low first-to default value, high n-th-to default value
- total rate of return swaps (TROR)
  receive floating rate(LIBOR) + fixed spread + depreciation
  pay realized return + appreciation
  hedges against default/credit deterioration/market risk
- credit-linked notes
  risk-free bond - CDS = CLN
  least risky because of the amount to purchase risk-free bond can be used as safety for CDS

8. vulnerable option
just ordinary option with the possibilty that the sell may not pay
- without the default risk
  payoff = max(S-X, 0)
- with the default risk
  pahtoff = max(min(V, S-X), 0)
so the cor(V,S) is quite important in valuing the option
- if the cor(V,S) is positive, then basically no default risk
- if the cor(V,S) is negative, then huge default risk
you can use a option to hedge the default risk, with the payoff = max(S-X,0) - max(min(V,S-X),0)
given the no-default option value c,
vulnerable option = (1-PD)*c + PD*RR*c

9. credit risk in a swap
credit risk can be reduced by 
- requiring a margin
- netting the pmts
covenants
- full two-way pmt covenant - recevie net pmt no matter what
- limited two-way pmt covenant - abolished if either party defaults

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 21: spread risk and default intensity models
1. spread conventions
- yield spread
  ytm risk bond - ytm benchmark government bond
- i-spread 
  ytm risky bond - linearly interpolated ytm on benchmark government bond
- z-spread
  basis points added to each spot rate on a benchmark curve
- asset-swap spread
  spread on floating leg of sset swap on a bond
- CDS spread
  market premium of CDS of issuer bond
- option adjusted spread(OAS)
  z-spread adjusted for optionality of embedded options
- discount margin
  fixed spread above current LIBOR needed to price bond correctly

2. hazard rate (default density) curves
from previously, hazard rate = credit spread/LGD, P(t*<t) = 1 - e^(-lambd*t)
with varying hazard rate, lambd(t)
p(t*<t) = 1 - e^(-integrate lamda over t)
- upward-sloping (CDS) spread curve
  predicts that the default is unlikely in the near term but increases with time
- downward-sloping spread curve
  predicts high expectations of short-term default, but if it can survive, long-term spread are lower

3. spread risk
risk of loss from changes in the price of securities that have a postive probability of default


## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 22: portfolio credit risk
1. default correlation
cor(1,2) = (pd12 - pd1*pd2)/sqrt(pd1*(1-pd1)*pd2*(1-pd2))
by increasing the number of credit and reducing the weight, the portfolio is more "granular"

2. single-factor model
- use asset return to determine whether a firm will default
[1] alpha_i = beta_i * m + sqrt(1-beta_i^2) * epsilon_i
where alpha_i - asset return of i, m,epsilon ~ N(0,1), cov(m, epsilon)=0
    alpha_i ~ N(0,1)
- conditional independence 
  once asset returns for the market are realized, default risks are independent of each other
[2] given a certain mkt return, mean_m
    alpha_i = beta_i*mean_m + sqrt(1-beta_i^2)*epsilon
    alpha_i ~ N(beta_i*mean_m, 1-beta_i^2)
[3] cor = (phi(k,k) - pd^2) / pd(1-pd)

3. application
p(m) = phi((k-beta*mean_m)/sqrt(1 - beta^2))
