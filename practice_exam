3 - dtd - ln(V/F)/sigma_v,  sigma_v in percent%
    the lower the dtd, the more likely to default
44 - risk-neutral default probaility = real-world default probability + default risk premium + liquidity risk premium
63 - sigma_alpha = residual risk * IC
69 - dealt with
71 - derivative exposure (and other off-bal sheet items) are part of total exposure. as exposure declines, total capital ratop increase
     increase in CVA charge increase the amount of risk-weighted assets
     in NSFR, raise CET1 has a weight of 100%, invest in gold has a weight of 50%
74 - believe in yourself.
     the value of CDS will increase if the default prob increase, despite the wrong-way risk presented
