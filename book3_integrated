implementation of an ERM (enterprise risk mgt) system
- determine firm's risk appetite
- estimate capital requirement
- determine mix of capital and risk
- decentralize and distribute

correlation in risk aggregation
- firm-wide VaR
- diversification across risk categories

RAF (risk appetitie framework)
- strong internal relationships at firm/ strong accountability structure/ common risk appetite language
- risk appetite statement establishes  
  boundaries for the desired business/ desired approach to a varity of business and risk areas/
- flexible and responsive to environment changes/ prepare for unexpected things
should have or do
- strong support from CEO/ strong alliance between CRO and CFO
- each business line align with firm's risk appetite/ analyze mid-term business plan/ keep from unknowingly drift

IT infrastructure
- aggregate timely and accurate data/ internal risk reporting requirements/ bring together IT person and business line
should 
- appoint a data administator and a data owner for data accuracy, integrity and avilable/ internal audit
why bad IT 
- competition between business line and IT/ budget reduction due to short-term consideration
  bad governance/ mergers could produce multiple platform
why bad data aggregation
- manual intervention/ multiple infrastructure platform/ legal-entity instead of firm-wide
best practices
- limited reliance on manual intervention/ consolidated platforms and database
  cover all relevent transactional and accounting system/ periodic reconciliation between risk and financial data


capital mgt (by firm, as oppsed to by Basel)

risk-adjusted return on capital
RAROC = risk-adjusted return/Economic Capital(EC)
where risk-adjusted return = revenues + return on EC(risk-free) - (operating and interest) expenses - EL - taxes
      economic capital = UL = WCL - EL
      taxes on (revenues + return on EC(risk-free) - (operating and interest) expenses - EL)
compare RAROC to cost of equity 
assumptions: through-the-cycle PD, which reduce volatility

hurdle rate
- after-tax weighted-average cost of equity capital
h_at = (commonEquity*R_ce + preferredEquity*R_pe)/(commonEquity + preferredEquity)
cost of preferred equity R_pe - yield
cost of common equity R_ce - capm

adjusted RAROC
- takes into account the systematic risk
adjusted RAROC = RAROC - beta*(R_m - R_f)
compare it risk-free rate, instead of hurdle rate
- best practice
  senior mgt commitment/ communication and education/ ongoing consultation
  integrity of the process/ combine with qualitative factors/ active capital mgt process
  
economic capital framework
- risk measures (VaR or ES)
- risk aggregation (interactions between risk)
- dependency modeling in credit risk (correlation estimates, especially PD-dependent)
- counterparty credit risk (tradeoff between methods)

Federal Reserve's Capital Plan Rule
mainly on BHC bank holding corporations
CCAR (comprehensive capital analysis and review)
