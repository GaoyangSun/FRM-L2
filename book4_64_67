READING 64: factor theory
1. principles
- factor, rather than assets, are important
- assets represent bundles of factors
- investors have differing optimal risk exposures

2. lessons from CAPM
[1] hold the factor, not the individual asset
- mean-variance efficient portfolio maximize Sharpe ratio, the combo of MVE and risk-free asset depends on risk aversion
- equilibrium, demand for an asset equals the supply
[2] investors have their own optimal factor risk exposures
[3] the average investor is fully invested in the market
- an investor with an average risk aversion would hold 100% MVE portfolio
[4] exposure to factor risk must be rewarded
- E(Rm) - Rf = riskAver*Var_m
- the more volatile the market, AND the more risk aversed the investor, the higher the risk premiums should be
[5] risk is measured as beta exposure
- SML - E(Ri) - rf = (cov(Ri, Rm)/var(Rm))*(E(Rm) - rf)
[6] valuable assets have low risk premiums

3. limited assumptions of CAPM
[1] investors only have financial wealth   - human capital
[2] investors have mean-variance   - skewness, kurtosis
[3] investors hvae a single period investment horizon
[4] investors have homogeneous expectations
[5] markets are frictionless
[6] all investors are price takers
[7] information is free and available to everyone

4. multifactor models
- APT, arbitrage pricing theory, deduced from stochastic discount factor(SDF)

5. efficient market theory
near-efficient
- active managers search for pockets of inefficiency, and in doing so cause the market to be almost efficient.
rational explanation approach
- losses during bad times are compensated by high returns/ but what are bad times?
behavioral explanation approach
- it is agents' (over/under) reactions to news that generates high returns

READING 65: factor
1. Macroeconomic Factors
[1] economic growth
in recession, government (and investment-grade) bonds are best (even better than that in expansion), albeit more volatile
high-yield bond are indifferent to economic conditions
[2] inflation
bad for both stock and bond.
not that bad for commodities and real estate
[3] volatility
- leverage effect 
cor(volatility, realized return) < 0
cor(volatility, expected return) > 0
price up - equity up - leverage down - risk down
risk down - lower expected return from CAPM - lower discount rate - higher price 
(expected return goes down, realized return goes up)
- unnamed effect
VIX increases when stock market goes down
[4] other factors
- productivity shock
- demographic risk
- political risk

2. investment style
- static (passive)
market factor Rm - rf
- dynamic (active)
[1] SMB   
- size strategy: small cap - large cap
[2] HML
- value strategy: value (high b2m) - growth (low b2m)
[3] WML
- momentum strategy: winner - loser

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 66: alpha
1. low-risk anomaly
- firms with lower betas and lower volatility have higher returns over time
- Data evidence
  [1] cor(var(t-1), r(t))<0, cor(var(t), r(t))<0
   most volatile stocks that currently lose money will continue to lose money in the future
  [2] cor(beta(t-1), r(t))=0, cor(beta(t), r(t))>0

2. measurements
alpha = T mavg excess_return
tracking error = standard deviation of excess return
information ratio = alpha/tracking error
sharpe ratio = (r - rf)/standard deviation of return 

3. benchmark
- well-defined
- tradeable
- replicable
- adjusted for risk

4. fundamental law of active management
IR = IC * sqrt(BR)
where IC - info coef - cor(predicted value, actual value)
      BR - breadth - # investments deployed
      
5. factor regression
style analysis: a form of factor benchmarking where the factor exposures evolve over time

6. alphas for nonlinear strategies
tradeable - Var_m: VIX,  max{s-x,0}: call option

7. risk anomaly explanations
[1] data mining
[2] leverage constraints - cannot borrow money and instead to long beta
[3] agency problem - institutional managers cannot short sell
[4] preferences

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 67: illiquid assets
1. characteristics of illiquid markets
[1] most assets are illiquid, at least to some degree
[2] markets for illiquid assets are large
[3] illiquid assets comprise the bulk of most investors' portfolios
[4] liquidity can dry up even in liquid asset markets

2. market imperfections
- market participation costs
- transactions costs
- search frictions (hard to find a counterparty)
- asymmetric information
- price impacts
- funding constraints

3. returns are overstated because of biases like:
- survivorship bias
  [1] poorly performing funds may not reoirt
  [2] studies only include survived funds
- (sample) selection bias
  [1] real estate are often sold where prices are high
  [2] buyout funds take company public when values are high/ VC sell companies when values are high
- infrequent trading - result in lower volatility, beta, correlation, higher autocorrelation

4. collect illiquidity risk premiums
[1] holding passive allocations to illiquid asset classes
- illiquidity biases
- ignored risk (fraud risk)
- no market index
- always a bet on management skill
[2] holding less liquid securities within asset classes
- on-the-run > off-the-run
- small > large bid-ask spread
- small > large bid-ask spread, large > small volume/turnover 
- larger risk premiums exist within asset classes than across because
  constraint on switching capital/investor overpay(because of limited knowledge)/illiquidity-shy investor overpay 
[3] market making at the individual security level
[4] dynamic rebalancing at the aggregate level (simplest and most affective on portfolio returns)
