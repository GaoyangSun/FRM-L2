- three pillars of credict risk
- PD (probaility of default)  LR (loss rate)  EA (exposure amount)

READING 16: the credit decision
1. credit risk comes from
- default on an obligation
- increased PD
- increased LR
- increased EA
- settlement risk

2. 4 primary components of credict risk evaluation
- obligor's capacity and willingness to repay
- external conditions
- attributes of obligation (fixed or floating)
- credit risk mitigants

3. credit analysis techiniques
- qualitative to decide willingness to pay
  gather info/face-to-face meetings/"name lending"/extrapolating last performance into future
  
- quantitative to decide ability to pay
  examine the past, current, forecasted financial statements
  limitations: historical nature of the data/ difficult to make accurate projections
  
4. categories of analysis
[1] consumers
    - credit score
[2] corporations
    - liquidity, cash flow with earning capacity and profitability
[3] financial institutions
    - capital adequacy, asset quality, ability to withstand financial stress
    - bank insolvency <> backruptcy
[4] sovereigns
    - external debt, tax receipts
    
5. measures
PD - probaility of default
LGD - loss given default
EAD - exposure at default
EL - expected loss = PD * LGD * EAD
time horizon - the longere the horizon, the greater the risk

READING 17: the credit analyst
1. JD
- consumer credit analyst
  admin role, mostly with individual consumer mortgages
- credit modeling analyst
  quant role, with credit scoring systems
- corporate credit analyst
  non-financial
- counterparty credit analyst
  financial
- credit analyst at rating agencies
- sell-side and buy-side fixed-income analysts
- bank examiners and supervisors

2. by employer
- financial institutions
- rating agencies
- government agencies
- rating advisor

3. corporate credit analyst
- the larger the company, the more the info, the lower the cost, and vice versa
- an analyst will most likely focus on one or two industries
- cash flow analysis is the key to corporate credit risk assessment

4. banking credit analyst
- counterparty credit analyst
  do risk management/ help to reach conclusions and recommendations about allocation of credit limits et al.
- fixed-income and equity analyst
  fundamentail and technical analysis/help to select the investment
  
5. tools and methods
- primary research skill
  first-hand material of financial statements
- secondary research skill
  use research published

READING 18: classifications of credit risk
1. credit ratings are critical in ensuring
- borrowers can access capital market
- the various risks of value creation are appropriately managed
- the economic performance of business units can be compared

2. classification
- default(counterparty) risk
  measured by PD, which can be approached by 
  [1] analyze historical default frequencies
  [2] statistical [3] hybird approach combining quant and qual approach
  [4] extract implicit default probailities
- recovery risk
  measured by LGD, which depends on
  [1] type of credit contracts [2] general economic conditions [3] covenants
- exposure risk
  measured by EAD, calculated by 
  EAD = drawn amount + (limit - drawn amount) * LEQ
  where drawn amount = amount of the credit facility currently used
               limit = max amount granted by a bank to the borrower
                 LEQ = loan equivalency factor
                 
3. measurement
- EL = PD * LGD * EAD = PD * (1-Recovery rate) * EAD
- Unexpected Loss = credit VaR = WCL(worst case loss) - EL
- EL not affected by correlation, UL affected by correlation
- loss distribution and VaR measures can be done by
  [1] adopting a parametric method
  [2] numerical simulations
  [3] discrete probability solutions
- VaR and EL do not factor in portfolio concentration because of diversification
  so concentration risk should be noted, as VaR does not account for that
  default codependence can be modeled by 
  [1] asset value correlations
      consider the debt outstanding between two borrowers and look at the correlation among asset values
  [2] default correlations
      historical correlations 
- unexpected loss contribution
  ULC_i = (d_UL_portfolio/d_w_i)*W_i
        = correlation(i, portoflio) * W_i * UL_portfolio
  beta_i = (ULC_i/W_i)*UL_portfolio
  
4. risk-adjusted pricing
- risk-based pricing policy is important for 
  active portfolio management/ integrating credit, market and operational risk into risk budgeting
  setting management objective
- risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)/risk-adjusted reutrn on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC)
  both used to assess whether returns generated > market risk premium
  add value if RARORAC > ROE_target
- economic value added
  EVA = (RARORAC - cost of capital) * economic capital
- RARORAC = (spread + fees - EL - cost of capital - cost of opearions)/economic

5. credit VaR vs. market VaR
- market VaR
  symmetric distribution/99% VaR/daily horizon
- credit VaR
  asymmetric distribution(skewed to the left)/99.9% VaR/yearly horizon

6. portfolio with two asset
- correlation = (PD_12 - PD_1*PD_2)/sqrt(PD_1*(1-PD_1))*sqrt(PD_2*(1-PD_2))
  if correlation = 0, then independent
- correlation = 1
  consider them as one credit
  credit VaR = WCL - EL = LGD * EAD - EL
- correlation = 0
  credit VaR = WCL - EL = PD_p * LGD * EAD - EL
  PD_p follows bernouli distribution

READING 19: rating assignment methodologies
1. rating system
- objectivity and homogeneity
- specificity
- measurability and verifiability

2. approaches to predict default
- expert-based 
- statistical-based
  structural approaches - based on financial assumptions
  reduced-form approaches - purely statistical
- numerical

3. rating agencies
- moody's - issues
- S&P - issuer
- FITCH - issues and issuer

4. measurement of PD in rating system - based on historical data
- single period pd
  PD = default_t/total issuers
- cumulative pd
  PD_cumulative_t = sum over default_t/total issuers
- marginal pd
  PD_marginal_t = PD_cumu_t+1 - PD_cumu_t 
- forward probability
  PD_forward_t = default_t/survivied issuer @ beg
- annualized default rate (ADR)
  discrete: ADR_t = 1 - (1-PD_cumulative_t)^(1/t)
  continuous: ADR_t = - ln(1 - PD_cumulative_t)/t
  
5. consider a zero-coupon with face value of 1
(PD*RR + (1-PD)*1)/1+rf = 1/1+YTM
PD = (1/LGD) * (YTM - rf)/(1+YTM)
credit spread = YTM - rf ~ PD * LGD
credit risk premium ~ pricing of a unit loss from credit risk

6. spread01
- price change by on basis point change in credit spread
- z-spread is added to LIBOR to do discounting
