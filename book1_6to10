READING 6: correlation basics: properties, motivation, terminology
1. category
- static financial correlation
measure the relationship between assets for a specific time period - do not change
e.g. VaR, correlation copulas, binominal default correlation
- dynamic financial correlation
measure the comovement of assets over time
e.g. pairs trading, deterministic correlation approaches, stochastic correlation processes

2. wrong way risk
e.g.1 invest a bond in Spain, and long a CDS(like insurance) from a French bank
due to the high correlation among Europe countries, both could default
e.g.2 invest in Nikkei(Jap stock mkt), and long a quanto call(call on exchange rate)
due to the high correlation between Jap stock mkt and the value of Jap money,
when the mkt rises, the quanto become useless

3. ways to long correlation
- corrlation swap
long correlation = pay a fixed correlation + receive a float(actual) correlation
the payoff = NP*(acutal cor - fixed cor)
cor_actual = (2/(n^2 - n))*cor(i,j)  [i>j]
- long call on Dow Jones, short call on individual stocks
when correlation rise(bear mkt), both underlyings goes down
but more volatility in Dow Jones due to the correlation, less volatile in stocks
more value of call on Dow Jones, less value of call on indi stock
u make money
- variance swap
long variance(pay fix, receive float) on index
short variance(pay float, receive fix) on stock
equalize two fixes, you receive float on index and pay float on stock
when correlation rise, more volatile on index, less volatile on stock
u make money

4. 2005 credit crisis
CDO - senior/mezzanine/equity
[1]they short the CDS(insurance) on equity and long the CDS on mezz
[2]and the correlation of payment goes down
cor goes down - 
[1]value of equity goes down - risk of equity goes up - premium of equity goes up - paper loss on CDS already short
[2]value of mezz goes up - risk of mezz goes down - premium of mezz goes down - paper loss on CDS already long
u lose money

5. 2007-8 credit crisis
[1]they long equity
[2]and the correlation of payment goes up
which is good because the value of equity increase, u make some money
but the rising correlation is due to default on payment, u lose more money

6. credict risk
default correlation within sectors is higher than between sectors
the longer the time horizon, the higher the probability of adverse events

7. systemic risk
systemic risk and correlation risk are highly dependent
portoflios considered well-diversified in benign times may encounter a sharp increase in correlation and incur unexpected loss

8. concentration risk
A and B both default
P(AB) = cor(A,B)*sqrt(PD_A*(1-PD_A)*PD_B*(1-PD_B)) + PD_A*PD_B

9. default term structure
for most investment grade bonds, increases slightly with time to maturity
for non-investment grade bonds, the probability is higher in the immediate time horizon

READING 7: empirical properties of correlation
in good times - low correlation, low correlation volatility
in bad times - high correlation, high correlation volatility
- mean reversion triumphs autocorrelation
- before every recession, a downturn in correlation volatility

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 8: correlation models
1. limitations of financial models
- inaccurate input
mkt values are as rational as the investors who made the decision
- erroneous assumptions regarding underlying asset distribution
VaR - return follow normal distribution (higher kurtosis, fatter tails)
BSM - strike prices have constant volatility (higher volatility for out-of-the money option and volatility skew in equity mkts)
- mathematical inconsistencies
BSM - when knock-out price = strike price and interest rate = underlying asset return,
      up-and-out/down-and-out calls/puts, the model insensitive to changes in implies volatility and option maturity

2. limitations of financial model outputs
copula failed for
[1] assumptions that a negative correlation between the equity and senior tranches of CDOs
[2] model calibrated with volatility and correlation estimates with date from past period

3. limitations of pearson correlation
[1] linear dependencies
[2] correlation of 0 does not imply independence (x^2~x)
[3] require elliptical joint distribution (normal or t)
[4] variance of X and y have to finite
[5] cannot do transformed data (no ln(x))

4. Spearman's rank correlation
step 1: (X,Y) to (sorted(X), Y[np.argsort(X)]
step 2: rank(sorted(X)), rank(Y[np.argsort(X)]
step 3: sum((rank(sorted(X)) - rank(Y[np.argsort(X)]))^2)
step 4: 1 - 6*step3/n(n^2-1)

5. Kendall's t
for any pair (x1,y1), (x2,y2)
concordant pair: sgn(x1-x2) = sgn(y1-y2)
discordant pair: sgn(x1-x2) = -sgn(y1-y2)
t = (nc-nd)/((n(n-1)/2)

6. limitations of ordianl
- less sentitive to changes or outliers than cardianl
- kendall's t may have non-con/discordant pair

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 9: copula
- def
a joint multivariate distribution that describes how variables from marginal distributions come together
by mapping multiple distributions to a single multivariate distribution

copula function, C: [0,1] n-d to [0,1] 1-d
C[G_1(u_1),...,G_n(u_n)] = F_n[F_1_inverse(G_1(u_1)),...,F_n_inverse(G_n(u_n));cor_F]
G(i) - marginal distribution
F_n - joint cumulative distribution
cor_F - correlation matirx of F_n
marginal PD - cumulative PD Q(t) - Normal percentiles N_inverse(Q(t))

M_n(.) = Q_i(t_i)
random samples are drawn from an n-var standard normal distribution sample M_n(.) 
to estimate expected default times using the Gaussian copula
