READING 27: credit exposure and funding
1. exposure metrics
- expected mark to market  MtM
  expected value at a given point
- expected exposure  EE
  the amount to be lost if postive MtM and the counterparty defaults
- potential future exposure  PFE
  an area of MtM value at a specific point in the future, based on a high C.I.
  max PFE - the highest PFE value over an interval
- expected positive exposure  EPE
  average of EE through time
- negative exposure
  the exposure from the counterparty's view
  EE ~ NEE EPE ~ ENE
- effective EE
  non-decreasing EE
- effective EPE  (rollover risk and short-term huge exposure
  average of effective EE through time
  
2. compare to VaR
- application
  credit exposure to pricing and risk mgt, VaR only in risk mgt
- time horizon
  credit exposure over many horizons, VaR in a short horizon
- risk mitigants
  credit exposure by netting and collateral
  
3. factors affect credit exposure
future uncertainty/ periodic cash flows/ combination of profiles/ optionality

4. security exposure profiles
- loans,bonds and repos
  mostly equal to notional value
  bond - fixed rate, affected by interest rate
  loan - floating rate, affected by prepayments
  repo - haircut
- forward
  exposure is increasing function of time, showing increasing uncertainty
- interest rate swap (no principal involved)
  uncertainty and remaining pmt - peaked shape
- cross-currency swap (principai involved)
  = interest rate swap + currency forward   increasing
- CDS
  = pay fixed (insurance) + receive floating   -  EE  like interest rate swap
  may roar to sky because default happens, then expect a huge money incoming,  EPE 
  
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 24: counterparty risk
1. different from lending risk from
uncertain exposure/ bilateral

2. transactions
- securities financing transactions
  repo - short-term lending agreements secured by collateral
  borrower sell securities to lender to get cash, then buy back the securities later
  lender gets repo rate = rf + counterparty risk charge
- OTC derivatices
  interest rate swaps - netting reduces the counterparty risk
  foreign exchange transactions - huge risk due to the notional amount exchange
  CDS - huge risk due to wrong-way risk and volatility

3. managing counterparty risk
- trade with high-quality couterparties
- cross-product netting 
  combine transactions with the same counterparty
- close-out
  close of all contracts with the defaulted counterparty
- collateralization
- walk-away feature
  allows a party to cancel the transactions if the couterparty defaults (on other transactions)
- diversification
- reset agreement
  avoids a party is deep in-the-money, reset parameter to be more at-the-money

4. XVA
- CVA  credit value adjustment
  [1] one-time
  CVA = LGD * sum_over EE(t_i)*PD(t_i-1, t_i)
  where EE - the discounted expected exposure, PD - marginal PD
  [2] fee rate each year
  CVA = EPE * spread
  wrong-way risk: cor(PD, EAD)>0
- DVA  debt value adjustment
- BCVA  bilateral CVA
  [1] one-time
  BCVA = LGD_c * sum_over EE(t_i) * SR_p_t_i * PD_c_(t_i-1, t_i)
       - LGD_p * sum_over NEE(t_i) * SR_c_t_i * PD_p_(t_i-1, t_i)
  [2] fee rate
  CVA = EPE * CS_c - ENE * CS_p
- FVA  funding value adjustment     cost/benefit from funding a transaction
- ColVA collateral value adjustment    cost/benefit from embedded options in collateral
- KVA  capital value adjustment   cost of holding capital over the transactions
- MVA  margin value adjustment  cost of posting margin over the transactions

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 25: netting, close-out
1. ISDA Master Agreement rules
collateral/ event of default and termination/ combined into a single net obliagtion/ close-out

2. Netting
- pmt netting
  net cash flows on the same day, reduces settlement risk
- close-out netting
  cancel all transaction with a counterparty under default, reduces pre-settlement risk
- trade compression
  multilateral netting, same product with the same maturity
  
3. correlation impact
postive correlation provides lower benefit than negative correlation

4. netting factor
assume asset values follow multivariate normal distribution zero mean and equal standard deviation
- EE(neting)/EE(no netting) = sqrt(n+n(n-1)cor)/n
  where n - # exposure cor - mean of correlation
  
5. termination
- additional termination event (ATE)
  terminate in situations like rating downgrade
- break clauses or mutual puts
  mandatory/optional/trigger-based break
  allows a party to terminate a transaction at a future date at replacement value
  not popular because effective break are early, but it would jeopardize the relationship
  
  
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 26: collateral
1. Credit Support Annex (CSA)
- one-way CSA/two-way CSA
- threshold
- minimum transfer amount (MTA)
  (MtM) exposure > threshold + MTA
- initial margin
  posted upfront irrespective of exposure
- haircut
  1-x% credit will be given for every unit of security posted
  
2. funding aspect
- rehypothecation  (re-collateralization)
  dangerous since it may not be received
- segregation
  cannot re-collateralize, use third-party
  
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 28: counterparty risk intermediation
1. counterparty risk intermdeidaries
- SPV
to create a bankruptcy-remote entity and give a counterparty preferential treatment when default
may introduce legal risk, separation may not be effective
- DPC (derivative product company)
to create a bankruptcy-remote entity and inject capital to gain a strong credit rating
spearation may not be effective, may further introduce operational and mkt risk
- monolines (monoline insurance company)
just do credit derivative product
should further consider wrong-way risk
- CCP (central counterparties)
require collateral posting and default funds
uniquely have liquidity risk and systemic risk

2. risk management of CCP
- netting
- margin requirement
  [1] variation margin
      closely track market movement, transfer on a daily/intra-daily basis
  [2] inital margin
      based on worst-case liquidataion/close-out costs, transfer upfront
- auction
  auction the defaulter's contractual obligations with multilateral netting
- loss mutualisation
  loss dispersed across all the default funds of members
- in extreme situation
  [1] additional call for default fund
  [2] variation margin haircutting  - receive full collateral, pay collateral with haircut
  [3] seletive tear-up  - tear up unmatched contracts
- loss waterfall
  defaulter's fund - CCP's reserve - members' fund - extra call for fund - liquidation/injection

3. capital charges with CCP
- trade exposures
  from MtM exposure and variation margin, with potential future exposure and initial margin
  only affected when CCP defaults
- default fund exposures
  can by affected by defaults of members
  
4. pros and cons
reduce systemic risk by diversifying, reduce but not eliminate counterparty risk
pro: transparency/ netting/ loss mutialisation/ legal and operational efficiency/ liquidity/ default mgt
con: moral hazard - little incentive to manage risk
     adverse selection - trade with CCP that offer the best price due to incomplete info
     bifurcations - difference between OTC and CCP
     procyclicality - initial margin high in bad mkts, low in good mkts

5. effect on xVA
- less CVA, FVA and KVA
- more MVA from more margin
