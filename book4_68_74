READING 68: portfolio construction
1. inputs
[1] current portfolio
[2] alphas ~ both the investor and manager constraints are considered
- scaling
  alpha = sigma * IC * score
  where sigma - tracking error, score - standard normal distribution
  so alpha ~ N(0,squred(IC*sigma)), and compare to actual volatility of alphas, and scale
- triming
- neutralization
  set alpha of benchmark to be 0
  alpha_Rp = 5%, alpha_benchmark = 1%, beta_Rp = 1.5
  benchmark-neutral alpha = alpha_Rp - beta_Rp*alpha_benchmark = 5% - 1.5*1% = 3.5%
[3] covariances
[4] transaction costs
- transaction costs must be amorized over the horizon of the benefit from the trade
- benefits (increase in alpha) occur over time, transaction costs occur @ specific time
[5] active risk aversion (lambd)
- utility = alpha - lambd*trackingError**2
  lamdb = IR/2*trackingError

2. techniques
portfolio alpha - riskAver*active risk**2 - transaction costs
[1] screen
- rank stocks by alpha/ choose top stocks/ average weighting
- pro: enhances returns/diversification/robust
- con: only use input alpha/ excluding certain industry with low alpha
[2] stratification
- rank stocks by alpha, industry/ ...
- no transaction costs
[3] linear programming
- rank stocks by alpha, industry, size, volatiliy, beta.../ ...
- pro: create a portfolio that closely resembles the benchmark
- con: may not have enough pre-specified stocks
[4] quadratic programming
- consider all the inputs
- con: more inputs mean more noise

3. porfolio reversions (rebalancing)
- no-trade region: benefit < transaction costs
marginal contribution to the value added = alpha - 2*riskAver*activeRisk*marginal contribution to the active risk 
so no-trade region: - cost of selling < marginal contribution to value added < cost of purchase
   when you buy, you get alpha and add more risk and pay purchase cost
           sell, you lose alpha and reduce risk and pay selling cost
rearranging (plus 2*riskAver*marginal contribution to active risk on all side):
2*riskAver*marginal contribution to active risk - cost of selling < alpha < 
2*riskAver*marginal contribution to active risk + cost of purchase
- the manager should assign a tracking portfolio weight equal to zeros for stocks
  which there is a forecast but that are not in the benchmark

READING 69: portfolio risk: analytical methods
1. portfolio VaR
- VaR_p = Z*sigma_p*V
  sigma_p = sqrt((w1*sigma1)^2 + (w2*sigma2)^2 + 2*w1*w2*sigma1*sigma2*cor(1,2))
- VaR_p = sqrt(VaR_1^2 + VaR_2^2 + 2*VaR_1*VaR_2*cor(1,2))
- if equally weighted/identical sigma/identical correlation
  sigma_p = sigma*sqrt(1/N + (1-1/N)*cor)
- individual VaR - VaR of an individual position in isolation
  VaR_i = Z*sigma_i*V_i
  
2. marginal VaR
per unit change in a portfolio VaR / additional investment in a position
MVaRi = d_VaR_p/d_V_i
      = d_(Z*sigma_p*V_p)/d_(w_i*V_p)
      = Z*(d_sigma_p/d_w_i)
      = Z*(cov(R_i, R_p)/sigma_p)     and because beta_i = cov(R_i, R_p)/sigma_p^2
      = (VaR_p/V_p) * beta_i

3. incremental VaR
change in portfolio VaR / additonal new postion
incremental VaR = VaR_p+i - VaR_p
                = MVaR_i * w_i

4. component VaR
contribution of risk from a to a portoflio
CVaR_i = MVaR_i * V_i
CVaR_i/VaR_p = ((VaR_p/V_p)*beta_i)*V_i/VaR_p
             = w_i*beta_i
             
5. risk parity
all component make the same risk contribution
CVaR1 = CVaR2 = ...

6. global minimun
minimize portfolio risk
MVaR1 = MVaR2 = ...
or minimize sigma_p

7. risk budget (across portfolios)
maximize portfolio sharpe ratio
(R1 - rf)/MVaR1 = (R2 - rf)/MVaR2 = ...

READING 70: VaR and risk budgeting in investment management
1. investment process
[1] determine the long-term, strategic asset allocations
    usually based on methods like mean-var optimization
[2] choose the passive and active managers

2. risks
- absolute/asset risk
  total possible losses = policy mix risk + active management risk
  R_asset = R_policyMix + R_activeMgt
          = sumOver(w_i_benchmark*r_i_benchmark) + sumOver(w_i_actual*r_i_actual - w_i_benchmark*r_i_benchmark)
  VaR_p = (VaR_policyMix^2 + VaR_activeMgt^2 + 2*VaR_policyMix*VaR_activeMgt*cor(policyMix,activeMgt)
- policy mix risk (various benchmarks risk)
  dollar loss owing to the policy mix selected by the fund
- avtive management risk
  dollar loss owing to the deviations from the policy mix
- relative risk
  dollar loss relative to a benchmark
  trackingError = R_p - R_b
  trackingErrorVolatility = (sigma_p^2 - 2*cor(p,b)*sigma_p*sigma_b + sigma_b^2)^0.5

3. funding risk (not literally)
the risk that the value of asset would be enought to cover the liabilities
- surplus = assets - liabilities
- delta_surplus = delta_assets - delta_liabilities
- R_surplus = delta_surplus/assets
            = delta_assets/assets - (delta_liab/liab)*(liab/assets)
            = R_asset - R_liab*(liab/assets)
- surplus at risk (SaR)  which is VaR of surplus
  expected surplus = A*(1+R_A) - L*(1+L_A) 
  sigma_surplus = ((A*sigma_A)^2 + (L*sigma_L)^2 - 2*sigma_A*sigma_L*cor(A,L))^0.5
  surplus at risk = expected surplus - Z*sigma_surplus
            
4. plan sponsor(owner) risk
- economic risk
  variation in the total economic earnings of the plan sponsor
- cash flow risk (surplus<0)
  variation of the contribution to the fund
  
5. why dramatic changes in risk
- a manager taking on more risk
- different managers taking similar bets
- more volatile markets

6. managers evaluation
- information ratio
  IR_i = expected excess return/manager's tracking error
  IR_p = expected excess return/portfolio's tracking error
- weight of portfolio managed by manager i
  w_i = (IR_i/IR_p) / (TE_i/TE_p)
      = (IR_I * TE_P) / (IR_P * TE_i)

READING 71: risk monitoring and performance measurement
1. risk planing
[1] setting expected return and volatility goals
[2] define quantitative measures of success or failure
[3] how risk capital will be used to meet object   -  RORC  return on risk capital
[4] define the difference between events that cause ordinary damage v. serious damage
[5] identify mission critical resources inside and outside

2. risk budgeting
across asset class/ managers/ portfolios
quantitative methods:
- set the min acceptable levels of RORC and ROE 
- apply mean-variance optimization to determine the weights for each asset classes
- simulate the portfolio performance based on the weights

3. risk monitoring
to seek and investigate any signifincant variances from budget

4. risk management unit
- monitors an investment management entity's portfolio risk exposures and 
  ascertains that the exposures are authorized and consistent with risk budgets previously set

5. liquidity duration
- the number of days necessary to dispose a portfolio;s holdings without a significant market impact
- LD = Q/(0.10*V)
  where LD - liquidity duration assuming that the desired max daily vol of any security is 10%
        Q - number of shares of the security
        V - daily vol of the security
        
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 72: portfolio performance evaluation
1. time/dollar-weighted return
dollar-weighted return: IRR on a portfolio, taking into account all cash flows
time-weighted return: geometric mean of the measurement period return

2. the green zone
- calculate normalized return and tracking error
- compare actual to target
green to yellow to red

3. ratios
sharpe ratio = (R_i - rf)/sigma_i  - total risk
treynor ratio = (R_i - rf)/beta_i  - systematic risk
info ratio = (R_i-r_bench)/sigma_(i-bench) - unsystematic risk
SR_i^2 - SR_bench^2 = IR_i^2
M^2 = (SR_i - SR_mkt)*sigma_mkt
T^2 = (TR_i - TR_mkt)*beta_mkt = TR_i - (Rm-Rf) - Treynor ratio - mkt risk premium

excess return = R_p - R_bench
alpha (by regression)  Rp - rf = alpha - beta*(Rm - rf) + error

4. significance of alpha
H0: alpha = 0 Ha: alpha<>0
t = alpha/(sigma_alpha/sqrt(N))
Jensen's alpha (acutal return - theortical return by capm or apt) = R_p - (rf + beta*(Rm - rf))

5. market timing (indifferent to asset allocation)
- here the timing refers to jugde a bull or a bear market, not individual stock
- method 1
R_p - rf = alpha + beta(R_m - rf) + M_p(R_m - rf)D + epslion_p
where D - 1 if up_market 0 if down_market
      M_p - up_market beta - down_market beta
- method 2
given perfect timing ability, you should get return of max(rm,rf)
as you can predict it is a bull or bear market
therefore, the price of timing ability should equal to call option whose X is (1+rf)

6. style analysis
step 1 - regress portfolio return against passive benchmarks (to get sensitivity b)
  R_p = b1*R_b1 + b2*R_b2 + ... + epslion
step 2 - performance attribution
  [1] asset allocation attribution (R-squared - explained part)
  b1*R_b1 + b2*R_b2 + ...  -  R_b
  [2] selection attribution (1 - R-squared - unexplained part)
  R_p - [b1*R_b1 + b2*R_b2 + ...]
step 3 - regression slopes (sensitivity) are used to infer the investment style

READING 73: Hedge Funds
1. characteristics
- private, less-regulated, highly leveraged, likely to short and use derivative
- while mutual funds are more structured and regulated

2. evoluation
1987-1996: easily outperform s&p500
1998: LTCM went down - which reduce investors' appetite for hedge funds
2000-: rapid expansion, institutions' appetite improved

3. biases
subject to surviorship/self-selection/backfill biases
backfill biases - creates instant history

4. strategies
[1] directional followers
- managed futures
- global macro
[2] event-driven 
- risk(merger) arbitrage - mainly deal risk
- distressed securities - similar returns with high-yield bond
[3] aribitarge - win most of time, lose huge rarely - payoff negative skewness
- fixed income
  swap spread trade: fixed side of the spread will be higher than floating side
  yield-curve spread trade: bond prices will deviate from overall yield curve, and will revert over time
  fixed income volatility trade: implied volatility of interest rates caps will be higher than relized
  captial structure/credit aribitrage trade: capitalize on mispricing among different types of securities
- convertible
  long convertible, short stock - long call option - net long gamma and vega
- long-short equity
[4] niche
- dedicated short bias
- emerging market
- equity market neutral (beta=0)
