Basel I
only consider credit risk
- cooke ratio
i.e. capital adequate ratio = "capital"/"asset" (8%)
- risk-weighted asset (RWA)
weight 0: cash, gold bullion, OECD government bond ... (now does not matter)
off-bal-sheet trans into in-bal-sheet - Max(V,0) + alpha*L
- capital
tier 1 capital - equity and non-cumulative (dividend) preferred stock. no goodwill (now does not matter)
tier 2 capital - cumulative preferred stock. some debt, least urgent to pay back

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1996 amendment
add a capital charge for market risk

credit risk - banking book
held to maturity and historical cost
market risk - trading book
held for short-term resale and mark to market

standardized approach (SA)
- classify into debt, equity, foreign exchange, commodities, and options
market risk charge MRC = sum over MRC for each class
internal models approach (IMA)
market risk charge MRC = max(prev 10day_VaR_@99%, 60 mavg 10day_VaR_@99% * 3~4) + SRC
where 3~4 based on backtestting, red/yellow/green
      SRC specific risk charge

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basel II
add a tier 3 capital - only for mkt risk

Pillar 1: minimum capital requirement
8% of risk-weighted asset
8% = total capital/ RWA_credit + RWA_mkt + RWA_op
   = total capital/ RWA_credit + MRC*12.5 + ORC*12.5
   
credit risk
- standardized approach
risk weights - by issuer and rating, retail (75%) or commercical
                  secured by residential mortgage (35%) commercial real estate (100%)
adjustment for collateral
[1] simple approach
    RWA = collateral * weight_collateral + (exposure - collateral) * weight_exposure
[2] comprehensive
    new exposure = exposure * (1 + adjustment factor) - collateral * (1 - adjustment factor)
    RWA = new exposure * weight_exposure
[3] internal ratings based apparoach (IRB)
use bank's own internal estimates to determine the risk weightings, to reduce the capital requirement
cannot be less than 90% of prev year, no less than 80% of last two yrs
- credit risk charge = WCL - EL = (WCDR - PD) * EAD * LGD * MA
where WCL_99.9_1yr = EAD * LGD * WCDR
      WCDR - worst case probaility of default - positive related to cor, PD
      MA - maturity adjustment - (1 + (M-2.5)*b) / 1 - 1.5*b
- correlation
corporate, sovereign, bank - cor = 0.12 + 0.12*exp(-50*PD)
retail exposure - cor = 0.03 + 0.13*exp(-35*PD)
- foundation IRB approach
  PD > 0.03%
  LGD - 45% for senior, 75% for subordinated
  M - 2.5
- advanced IRB approach
  own estimates of PD LGD EAD M
  
op risk
[1] basic indicator approach
ORC_BIA = 0.15 * average gross income   - no negative
[2] standardized approach
eight business line ...
ORC_SA = avg max sum over business gross income * beta
[3] advanced measurement approach (AMA)
ORC_AMA = WCL_1yr_99% - EL
frequency distribution + severity distribution _ convolve

Pillar 2: supervisory review process
principles 1 - process for assessing capital adequency
principles 2 - supervisor review
principles 3 - supervisor response
principles 4 - supervisor intervention

Pillar 3: market discipline
disclose

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solvency II
Pillar 1: minimun capital requirement
Pillar 2: supervisory review process
Pillar 3: market disclosure

capital requirement
Solvency capital requirement (SCR)
- 1-year, 99.5% VaR
if lower than this, deliver to the supervisor a plan to restore capital
investment risk = market risk + credit risk
underwriting risk = life insurance + non-life insurance + health insurance
operational risk

Minimum capital requirement (MCR)
- 25%-45% of the SCR
if lower than this, stop running the business

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basel II.5
- specifically targeted for market risk
concern 1: HS VaR has ghost effect
SVaR - stressed Value at Risk, based on 10-day, 99% from a significantly stressed period
max(SVaR_t-1,  Ms * SVaR_mean_60)
where Ms 3~4, depending on risk management quality

concern 2: trading book has lower capital requirement than banking book
IRC - incremental capital charge - 1-year, 99.9%
for credit sensitive product in trading book (s.t. you dont put that in trading book)

MRC_IMA = VaR + SVaR + SRC + IRC
        = max(VaR_t-1, VaR_60_mean*k) + max(SVaR_t-1, SVaR_60_mean*k_s) + SRC + IRC
        where k, ks > 3,  SRC and IRC are usually given

comprehensive risk measure(CRM)
special charge for creditcorrelate-dependent product

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basel III
why Basel III
- procyclical deleveraging

Tier 1 capital: common shares + retained earnings
additional Tier 1 capital: non-cumulative preferred stock
Tier 2 capital: subordinated debt with maturity > 5 years
no Tier 3

minimum capital requirement
T1 core >= 4.5%
T1 >= 6%
T1 + T2 >= 8%

against procyclical
- capital conservation buffer (CCB - 2.5%)
with CCB, T1 core >= 7%, T1 >= 8.5%, T1+T2>=10.5%
if T1 core>4.5% but <7% with CCB, less dividend should be delivery.
- countercyclical buffer
normal economic condition + <2.5%
recession + 0%
if not met, no dividend, discretionaty salary or stock repurchase

against leverage
leverage ratio = T1/total exposure >= 3%
total exposure is not related with risk

against liquidity
[1] liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
LCR = high quality liquidity assets/net cash outflows in 30 days >= 1
where HQLA (high qualitt liquidity assets) - high credit rating, certain valuation, low correlateion, exchange-traded
- HQLA = level 1 asset + level 2 asset
- Level 1 asset
  include cash, reserves, 0% risk-weighted marketable securities, non-zero risk-weighted securities of sovereign and central banks
- Level 2 asset
  can only comprise 40% of the high-quality 
- total net cash outflows
  = outflow - min(inflow, 75% outflow)
[2] net stable funding ratio (NSFR)
NSFR = available amount of stable funding/required amount of stable funding >= 1
  available - debt + equity, * available stable funding (ASF) factor
  required - asset, * required stable funding (RSF) factor

contingent convertible bonds (CoCos)
if T1 < x%, convert bonds to equity to increase T1

Dodd-Frank Act
try to learn and avoid GFC
- deposit insured by FDIC increased to $250,000
- Volcker rule - curtailed proprietary trading
- rating agencies make assumptions and method transparent
- independent directors in board
- systematically important financial institutions (SIFIs) - living wills

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
central clearing
in OTC, cleared through CCPs, traded on eletronic platforms, reported to trade repository

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRTB fundamental review of the trading book
- ES 97.5% 12-month instead of VaR 99% 10day
  12-month stressed period ES  -  max(yesterday, last 6 month)

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SMA for op risk capital charge
replace all methods in op risk
step 1: business indicator (BI)
BI = ILDC + SC + FC
where ILDC - interest, leases and dividend, SC - services, FC - financial
step 2: business indicator component (BIC)
BIC = BI * marginal coefficient
where marginal coefficient - progressive tax rate
step 3: internal loss multiplier (ILM)
ORC = BIC * ILM
