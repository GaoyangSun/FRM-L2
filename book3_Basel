Basel I
only consider credit risk
- cooke ratio
i.e. capital adequate ratio = "capital"/"asset" (8%)
- risk-weighted asset (RWA)
weight 0: cash, gold bullion, OECD government bond ... (now does not matter)
off-bal-sheet trans into in-bal-sheet - Max(V,0) + alpha*L
- capital
tier 1 capital - equity and non-cumulative (dividend) preferred stock. no goodwill (now does not matter)
tier 2 capital - cumulative preferred stock. some debt, least urgent to pay back

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1996 amendment
add a capital charge for market risk

credit risk - banking book
held to maturity and historical cost
market risk - trading book
held for short-term resale and mark to market

standardized approach (SA)
- classify into debt, equity, foreign exchange, commodities, and options
market risk charge MRC = sum over MRC for each class
internal models approach (IMA)
market risk charge MRC = max(prev 10day_VaR_@99%, 60 mavg 10day_VaR_@99% * 3~4) + SRC
where 3~4 based on backtestting, red/yellow/green
      SRC specific risk charge

Basel II
add a tier 3 capital - only for mkt risk

Pillar 1: minimum capital requirement
8% of risk-weighted asset
8% = total capital/ RWA_credit + RWA_mkt + RWA_op
   = total capital/ RWA_credit + MRC*12.5 + ORC*12.5
   
credit risk
- standardized approach
risk weights - by issuer and rating, retail (75%) or commercical
                  secured by residential mortgage (35%) commercial real estate (100%)
adjustment for collateral
[1] simple approach
    RWA = collateral * weight_collateral + (exposure - collateral) * weight_exposure
[2] comprehensive
    new exposure = exposure * (1 + adjustment factor) - collateral * (1 - adjustment factor)
    RWA = new exposure * weight_exposure
[3] internal ratings based apparoach
use bank's own internal estimates to determine the risk weightings, to reduce the capital requirement
cannot be less than 90% of prev year, no less than 80% of last two yrs
- credit risk charge = WCL - EL = (WCDR - PD) * EAD * LGD * MA
where WCL_99.9_1yr = EAD * LGD * WCDR
      WCDR - worst case probaility of default - positive related to cor, PD
      MA - maturity adjustment - (1 + (M-2.5)*b) / 1 - 1.5*b
- correlation
corporate, sovereign, bank - cor = 0.12 + 0.12*exp(-50*PD)
retail exposure - cor = 0.03 + 0.13*exp(-35*PD)
- foundation IRB approach
  PD > 0.03%
  LGD - 45% for senior, 75% for subordinated
  M - 2.5
- advanced IRB approach
  own estimates of PD LGD EAD M
  
op risk
[1] basic indicator approach
ORC_BIA = 0.15 * average gross income   - no negative
[2] standardized approach
eight business line ...
ORC_SA = avg max sum over business gross income * beta
[3] advanced measurement approach (AMA)
ORC_AMA = WCL_1yr_99% - EL
frequency distribution + severity distribution _ convolve

Pillar 2: supervisory review process
principles 1 - process for assessing capital adequency
principles 2 - supervisor review
principles 3 - supervisor response
principles 4 - supervisor intervention

Pillar 3: market discipline
disclose
