READING 5: risk measurement for the trading book
1. VaR implementation
- time horizon
time horizon depends on [measurement purpose] and [portfolio liquidity]
for regulatory capital purpose, the horizon should be long
- time-varying volatility (and correlations)
as time horizon increase, the effect of time-varying volatility decrease
but ignoring it leads to an underestimation of risk
- backtesting
not effective when the number of VaR exceptions is samll
less effective over longer time horizons due to portfolio instability

2. integrating liquidity risk into VaR models
- exogenous liquidity
transaction costs, easily integrated using liquidity-adjusted VaR(LVaR)
- encogenous liquidity
market impact, the elaticity of prices to trading vols, difficult to integrate

3. ES better than VaR in terms of
- account for the severity of losses beyond the confidence threshold
- subadditive and coherent
- mitigates the impact of the choice of confidence level
spectral risk measure is a generalized form of ES, which takes aversion to risk into account

4. Integrated risk measurement
- compartmentalised approach
sum if risks measured separately, the approach that Basel takes
- unified approach
consider the interaction between risk

5. risk aggregation
- top-down approach
reference the institution as a whole, assume the risks are [cleanly separable] and can be aggregated in a way
risk diversification is present
- bottom-up approach
attempt tp account for interactions among risk factors
risk diversification should be questioned

6. balance sheet management
risks and regulatory capital charges can work as systemic [amplifier] of economic cycles
when a balance sheet is actively managed, leverage become procyclical
- economic boom - relax VaR constraint - equity expansion when price goes up - take more risk and increase debt
- economic bust - tighten VaR constraint - sell equity when price goes down - further reduce leverage
