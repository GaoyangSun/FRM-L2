READING 35: securitization
1. process
transform the illiquid asset into a package of ABS
bank (true sale to) SPV (make ABS to) investor
- loan originator (bank)
- underwriter (SPV)
- rating agencies
- servicers and managers
- trustee (can manage) and custodian (safeguard)

2. motivations
true sale/shrink bal sheet/decrease leverage/decrease regulatory and capital requirement

3. tranching
- senior/mezzanine/junior/equity/trust
- attachment point(start to lose money) to break point (all money out)
- waterfall (principal + interest)
  overcollateralization - more collateral to enhance the lower rated assets
  OC trigger - max amount allocated to equity tranch, the remaining goes to Trust

4. spv structure
[1] amortizing structure (mortgage)
    principal and interest paid on a coupon-by-coupon basis
    WAL (weihgted average life) - time-weighted outstanding period
[2] revolving structure (credit card)
    short-dated assets with high pre-pmt speed
    revolving period - principal collections are used to purchase new receivables
    amortization period - pmts to investor in equal instalments or a single lump of sum
[3] master trust (multiple securitizations)
    on demand

5. performance analysis
[1] for mortgages
measure prepayment risk
- PSA (public securities Association)
  assumed prepayment rate - 100% PSA: increase 0.2% per month until month 30, then remain constant
  [CPR/(0.2*months)]*100
- CPR (constant prepayment rate)
  1 - (1 - SMM)^12
- SMM (single monthly mortality)
  prepayment/outstanding pool balance
stat for the pool
- WAL (weighted average life of cash flows)
- WAM (weighted average maturity)
  value-weighted maturity
- WAC (weighted average coupon)  
  value-weighted coupon rate
- DSCR (debt service coverage ratio) 
  net operating income/debt pmts
[2] others
- MPR (monthly payment rate)
  collections/outstanding
- default ratio
  defaults/outstanding
- delinquency ratio
  delinquents(delay>90day)/outstanding

credit scenario analysis
- drawback: strong assumptions about constant default rate, same default prob each loan, no correlation
- simulation
  estimate parameters / generate default time simulations / compute the credit loss
  
- effect of increasing PD
  value: negative impact on all cash flow, all tranche value go down
  credit VaR (uncertainty): 
  - decrease for equity tranche (almost certain will lose money)
  - increase for senior tranche (maybe start to lose money)
  - low VaR, mezz like senior
  - high VaR, mezz like equity
  
- effect of increasing correlation
  if low PD, correlation does not matter
  VaR: all higher VaR because of uncertainty
  Value: 
  - decrease for senior tranche
  - increase for equity tranche       
  - mezz like above

- default 01
  impact of 1 bp in default rate
  up and down 10 bps

READING 36: the securitization of subprime mortgage credit
1. subprime borrower
  low quality borrower, bank does not care because it goes to SPV
2. subprime loan
- adjustable rate mortgages with both fixed and adjustable-rate feature
  2/28 or 3/27.  first 2 years, low fixed, then higher floating rate

3. predatory lending
   lender convinces the borrowe to borrow too much
4. predatory borrowing   
   borrower to convince the lender to lend too much
   
5. key frictions 
[1] predatory lending - lender to borrower
[2] mortgage fraud - lender (with more info) to arranger(SPV)
[3] adverse selection  - arranger (with more info) to asset manager
[4] moral hazard - borrower (less incentive to maintain collater due default) to servicer (who pay in advance)
[5] moral hazard - servicer (try to withhold info to get more service fee) to asset manager
                   servicer (try to get better rating) to credit agency
[6] principal-agent problem - asset manager (invest in riskier asset) to investor
[7] model error - rating agency (not differentiate bond and securitization) to investor

6. implications
[1] aligned relation between investor and asset managers
[2] structured investment to be evaluated relative to index of structured products
[3] originator and arranger to keep some equity tranche
[4] originator have adequate capital

READING 33: credit scoring and retail credit risk management
1. retail banking
- consumer deposit
- consumer lending
  home mortgages/ home equity loans/ installment loans/ credit card revolving loans/ small business loans

2. nature of retail credit risk
- well-diversified, single default does not matter
- easy to predict, expected loss can be into the price charges
- unexpected loss come from:
  innovation product/ sharp change in the economy/ social and legal system/ operational issue

3. key variables in mortgage credit assessment
[1] document type
    full doc/ stated income/ no income or asset/ no ratio/ no doc
[2] ratios
    - FICO
    - DTI  debt to income
    - LTV  loan to value (collateral)
    - pmt type (adjustable rate or ..)

3. credit scoring model
[1] credit bureau scores (FICO)
[2] pooled models (outsource model, indoor data)
[3] custom models (indoor data and model)

4. to measure scoring model
scorecard performance - acutal against predicted
cumulative accuracy profile (CAP)
accuracy ratio (AR) = A_r/A_p
