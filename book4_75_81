READING 75: cyber risk, market failures, and financial stability
1. reasons that the private market may fail to provide cyber security
- information asymmetries
  lack info about probaility of attack/potential damage/effectiveness of existing cyber security
- misaligned incentives
  successful attacks may cost reputation/ may underspedn on cybersecurity if have insurance
- externalities and coordination failures
  free-rider
- risk concentration
  same software(e.g. oracle) for financial services firm
  
2. systematic cyber risk
- common risk exposures
  common networks and platforms
- risk concentration
  a few financial institutions handle a high proportion of certain financial transactions
- contagion
  attack on one may affect others
  
3. increase resiliency to cyber risk
- basic measures for firms to increase
  whitelisting of all installed software/use of standardized secure system
  having procedures to patch vulnerabilities/limiting the number of people with access
- actions by regulators
  standardizing the reporting procedures
  create good incentives to report, and requiring them to report
  coordinating with other regulators by information sharing

READING 76: big data
1. issues with large dataset
- requires more advanced tools than spreadsheet
- overfitting
- active variable selection can help to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting
  
2. tools
- logit regression
- CART
- k-fold cross-validation
- conditional inference tree(ctree) does not require pruning/just one tree
  1. choose the most correlated independent variable with dependent variable
  2. split the variable into two dataset
  3. repeat until you have isolated vairables into unique components
- random forest - random (bootstrapped) sample and variables / no pruning
- penalized regression - LASSO

3. econometrics and machine learning
- machine learning focus mainly on cross-sectional data, 
  while econometrics can use Bayesian Structural Times Series models to forecast time series data
- causal inference
  
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 77: machine learning
1. concepts
- supervised/unsupervised maching learning
- regression/calssification/clustering
- overfitting/boosting/bagging/deep learning

2. applications
- financial institutions should use conventional maching learning for high-quality, structured supervisory data
  while deep learning should be used for low-quality, high-frequency, big data
- credict risk and revenue modeling
- fraud
- surveillance of conduct of market abuse in trading

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 78: AI
1. factors that have spurred adoption of AI
supply
- increasing computing power
- increasing availability of big data
- sophisticated new software
- decreased cost of data storage

demand
- decreased cost for fintech sulitions
- benefits for risk management
- ability to offer new product
- fraud protection
- data reporting requirement

2. applications
- customer-focused uses
  credit quality/ insurance risks/ virtual assistants
- operation-focused uses
  optimize capital allocation/ improve risk management
- trading and portfolio management
  assess the market impact/time trades to minimize execution costs/ analyze limit order book
  predict changes in prices and volatilities
- regulatory compliance (regtech)
  NLP to improve oversight and address product suitability/ evaluate impact of monetary policy
  identify violations of marketing rules

3. impacts
may lead to additional risks (if you dont understand how AI works)
may lead to correlated risks due to concentration

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 79: fintech
1. impact on operations management
- depersonalize client interactions (customized services instead of standardized)
- enchance access to on-demand services
- reduce customer acquisition costs

2. impact on lending and deposit services
- automate the credit scoring and loan approval
- alter the deposit-reliance and spread capture

3. impact on payment services
delayed net settlement(DNS) - settle the net amount and could take days
real-time gross settlement(RTGS) - transfer the fund on an immediate basis, may be a lag
blockchain - the validation process is not fast enough to support algo and high-frequency trading

4. impact on financial markets
- from physical trading locations to electronic trading platforms
  which was enbaled by the use of centralized limit order books where all open limit orders are aggregated before filled
- HFT and robo-advising
- increased volatility during duress

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 80: central clearinig and risk transformation
1. central counterparties(CCP) to clear over-the-counter(OTC) 
- eliminate counterparty risk, then no default risk
- with the advantages of 
  halting a potential domino effect of defaults in downturn/more clarity with the need for collateral
  lower operational risk/better price discovery/regulatory transparent/better risk management
  
2. impact of central clearing
- enhance financial stability and reduced systematic risk
- liquid refers to total liquid asset > total short-term liability
- solvent refers to total asset > total liability

3. counterparty risk to liquidity risk
- with bilateral OTC, no margin requirements/mark2market/impact on solvency but not liquidity
- with CCP, prepaid margin/settled on a cash and daily basis/no solvency impact but liquidity because of the reclassification
  because default fund contributions are subject to 2% capital charge so there is an impact on member's balance sheet

4. ccp loss sequence
- intial margin
- default contribution of defaulting member
- mutailization of large losses
- recovery
- failure resolution
- to conclude, liquidity risk is most relevant to ccp when absorbing losses

5. margin requirement and liquidation costs
- impose heavy liquidity demands on non-defualted members in weak market,
  which may cause them to default
- 2 methods to cope
  [1] default fund assessment
  ask all non-defaulted members for a supplementary contribution proportional to prior contribution
  [2] variation margin haircuts (VMGH)
  collects the full variation margin payment from the members with losses,
  discounts the payments the members with gains

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING 81: SOFR
- secured overnight financing rate
1. resources to derive SOFR
[1] BNY Mekkon tri-party GC - tri-party treasury general collateral(GC) repo transactions 
                              settled and cleared by the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon)
[2] FICC GCF - tri-party GC repo transactions made through Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC)
               General Collateral Finance (GCF) market
[3] FICC DVP bilateral - bilateral repo transactions that are cleared through the FICC's
                         delibery versus payment (DVP) services
these rates are weighted by transaction volume,
the median transaction-weighted rate is used as the day's SOFR

2. futures
one-month SOFR 
- average SOFR during the contract delivery month
- price basis - 100 - annual interest rate
- contract size $41.67 per basis point
three-month SOFR
- compounding of daily SOFR during the contract interval
- price basis - 100 - annual interest rate
- contract size $25 per basis point
