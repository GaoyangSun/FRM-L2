READING 11: the science of term structure
1. interest rate tree
no arbitrage opportunities for on-the-run(newly issued) bond
what we have here is recombining tree
assuming state-dependent volatility, it results in  nonrecombining trees

2. risk neutral
risk-neutral probailities: market price = discounted value using a binominal tree
risk-neutral probs - true probs = interest rate drift
risk-neutral pricing
- adjust the interest rates on the paths
- adjust the probs

3. option pricing
[1] price the bonds at nodes
[2] calculate the intrinsic value of option
[3] discount with risk-neutral probs

4. valuing CMT swap
CMT: constant maturity treasury
CMT swap: an agreement to swap floating rate for a Treasury rate such as the 10-year rate

5. OAS (option-adjusted spread)
the spread that makes the model value = current mkt price
only affect rates for discounting values, not estimating cahs flows

6. BSM cannot be used for pricing fix-income because:
[1] assume no upper limit. but bonds has max value when interest rate=0
[2] assume constant risk-free rate
[3] assume constant bond price volatility

7. bonds with embedded options
- callable bonds
issuer has the right to buy back at strike
for option-free bond, prices will rise unabated as yields falls
for callable bond at some point, price will start slow down and eventually level off - this is called negative convexity
- putable bonds
bondholder the right to sell the bond back at strike
at low yield levels, putable bonds is similar to non-putables because the holder will not excrcise
at high yield levels, putable bonds has more value

READING 12: the shape of term structure
1. pure expectations theory
term structre is a function of expected future spot rates
the shape of the spot rate curve is determined solely by expected future spot rates

2. the volatility of expected rates creates convexity, which lowers future spot rates

3. value of convexity increase with volatility
   the reduction in yields = value of convexity
   
4. value of convexity increase with maturity
   because the price-yield relationship will be more convex

READING 13: the art of term structure - drift
READING 14: the art of term structure - volatility and distribution
1. model I
- no drift and normally distributed interest rates
d_r = sigma*d_w
d_w = epsilon*sqrt(d_t)
where d_r: change in interest rates over d_t
      sigma: annual volatility
      d_w: N(0, d_t)
      epsilon: N(0, 1)
- possibility of negative short-term rates
solution 1: assume non-negative distributions
            such as lognormal or chi-squared distributions, but may introduce skewness or unwanted volatility
solution 2: force negative rates to 0
            better than solution 1
- effectiveness
[1] no-drift assumption does not give enough flexibility
[2] predicts a flat term structure of volatility, whereas the observed volatility term is bell-shaped
[3] has only one factor - short-term rate
[4] implies that change in short-term rate would lead to a parallel shift in the yield curve

2. model II
- with constant drift term, which could be interpreted as risk premium with longer horizons
d_r = lambda*d_t + sigma*d_w
- effectiveness
more effective than model I.
drift can be viewed as a combination of the risk premium and expected rate change

3. Ho-Lee model
- time-dependent drift
d_r = lambda(t)*d_t + sigma*d_w

4. arbitrage-free models and equlibrium models
- arbitrage-free models
used to quote the prices of securities that are illiquid or customized
2 detractors: [1] subject to the suitability of the original pricing model
              [2] assumes that underlying prices are accurate
- equilibrium models
to do relative analysis, comparing the value of one security to another

5. Vasicek model
- mean-reversion for short-term interest rates (breaks down during structural breaks such as hyperinflation)
d_r = k(theta-r)*d_t + sigma*d_w
k: speed of reversion
theta: long-run mean of short-term rate assuming risk neutrality
r: current level
theta = r1 + lambda/k
- effectiveness
improves the specification of the term structure, but also produces a downward-sloping term structure of volatility
in comparison, model I predicts flat volatility of interest, and implies parallel shifts, shocks affects all maturities

6. model III
- time-dependent drift and volatility
d_r = lambda(t)*d_t + sigma(t)*d_w
assuming volatility exponentially declines to 0, i.e. sigma(t) = sigma*exp(-alpha*t)
d_r = lambda(t)*d_t + sigma*exp(-alpha*t)*d_w
- effectiveness
[1] time-dependent volatility is more flexible, particularly useful for pricing multi-period derivatives.
[2] the market forecasts short-term volatility far out into the future, which is unlikely

7. Cox-Ingersoll-Ross(CIR) model
- basic-point volatility increases with the short_term rate (square root)
d_r = k(theta-r)*d_t + sigma*sqrt(r)*d_w

8. lognormal models
- cumulative effect is multiplicative
- model IV: basis-point volatility increase with short-term rate, yield volatility (sigma) stay constant
d_r = alpha*r*d_t + sigma*r*d_w
- Salomon Brothers model (lognormal with deterministic drift)
d_ln_r = alpha(t)*d_t + sigma*d_w
- Black-Karasinski model (lognormal with mean reversion)
- does not produce a naturally recombining interest rate tree (dt must be recalibrated to recombine)
d_ln_r = k(t)[ln_theta(t) - ln_r]*d_t + sigma(t)*d_w

READING 15: volatility smiles
1. put-call parity
C - P = S - Xexp(-rt)
"c minus p equals s minus x discount"
p_mkt - p_BSM = c_mkt - c_BSM
which implies that the implied volatility of a call and put will be equal

2. volatility smiles for foreign currency options (implied volatility ~ strike)
a lot of price jumps in foreign currency - fatter tails than lognormal - riskier(higher volatility) on tails
at the money options have the lowest volatility

3. volatility smirks(skew) for equity options
leverage + crashophobia - fatter left tail and thinner right tail than lognormal - riskier on left and less risky on right
at the money options does not have the lowest volatility

4. alternative ways to characterize the volatility smile
[1] replace X with X/S_0
[2] replace X with X/F_0  -  some think that the forward price is a better gauge
[3] replace X with options' delta

5. volatility term structure
when short-dated volatilities are low, volatility tends to be an increasing function of maturity
when short-dated volatilities are high, volatility tends to be an inverse function of maturity

6. volatility surface
combine volatility smiles with the time to maturity and K/S_0 (previously just strike)

7. option greeks
option greeks, such as vega and delta, may be affected by the implied volatility of an option
- sticky strike rule
  assumes that an option's implies volatility is the same over short time periods
- sticky delta rule
  assumes the relationship between an option's price and the ratio of underlying to strike price applies in subsequent periods
  as volatility reflects the moneyness of the option, so the delta calculation includes an adjustment factor
  if the rule holds, the option's delta will be higher than BSM
 
8. price jumps
停牌 - stock prices into a mixture of two lognormal distribution - volatility frown
