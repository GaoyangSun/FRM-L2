model risk in VaR
confidence interval, time period, assumptions about distribution

model risk in mapping
duration mapping/ CF mapping
different risk factors
basis risk in a position and its hedge, despite their similar properties

mitigating model risk
[1] improve model and develop bette stat tools
[2] independent vetting
    soundness of model - if it applies to the circumstance
    benchmark modeling - compare it with other models
    health check - does it satisfy basic condition, e.g. put-call parity
    
validating rating models (developed and adpoted in each company)
[1] quantitative
    - sample representativeness/ dynamic properties ï¼ˆrobustness)
    - calibration
      on predictive power of PD
      ex post - compare forecasted and realized
      ex ante - compare forecasted and other sources
    - discriminatory
      on differentiating power between default and non-default
      ex post - backtesting
[2] qualitative  
    - design
      obtain PD/ completeness/ objectivity/ acceptance/ consistency
    - data
      completeness of data/ volume of available data/ representativeness/ consistency and inregrity/ adequacy of process
[3] process
    building steps, weakness and limitations
    
Case 1: 2005 CDX.NA.IG credit correlation
action: sell protection on equity (long equity),
        buy protection on mezz (short mezz),
aim: default-risk-neutral, to earn a postive net spread
measure: default 01 to determine hedge ratio
assumption: constant correlation and recovery amount
fact: default correlation goes down
result: equity more likely to default, mezz less likely to default
        lose money on both sides
fix: stress test correlation
     overlay hedge - long single-name protection in high PD names
     
Case 2: 2007 subprime default models
assumption: house price appreciation/ low geographical correlation

Case 3: London Whale Trading 
operational risk: assign favorable closing prices to minimize loss
corporate govern: risk limits breaches were disregarded
model risk: adjust VaR model to lower VaR by 50%

Case 4: LTCM
assumption: time horizon - time it takes to raise new capital - should be longer
            liquidity risk was ignored
            correlation and volatilities were ignore
result: volatilities rose hugely
        correlateion between mkts and instruments close to 1
        liquidity dried up
